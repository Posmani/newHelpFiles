 Hi,
 Your hpc2 account has been created.
 Please type in your MobaXterm, putty or other terminal:
 ssh wdlynch@hpc2.engr.ucdavis.edu
 If you get prompted for `password', type CTRL C, cut above *command* with output
 and paste into email (instead of screenshot)
 Then, insert -vvv after ssh and cut *command* with output and paste into email:
 Then, cut following *command* with output and paste into email:
 ls -latrR .ssh
 It is fine to have a single pair of keys for many hosts--all in .ssh
 Thanks!
